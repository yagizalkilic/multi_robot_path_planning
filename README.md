# Multi-Robot Path Planning on Predefined Routes

## Problem Definition

A set of n robots travel along predefined paths. The purpose of this project is to coordinate these robots without any alteration to their paths, only changes that can be made are to robots' velocities and durations of velocity application. The project utilizes coordination graphs and RRT/RTT* algorithms to solve the problem. More information regarding the methodology is explained later.

## Program Information

### Turtlesim Implementation

Turtlesim package is used to simulate the problem and test the solution. The main purpose of this implementation is to apply the schedule that was generated by RRT* to a representation of the physical world. This simulation cannot enforce acceleration limits.

- The path_scheduling_turtle_sim_tests package contains 5 executables. (In order to execute the program, https://root.cern/ should be installed.)

    - turtle_publisher:  generates turtles from turtlesim library, generates paths for the turtles, and calculates schedules for the paths.

    - turtle_subscriber: makes the turtles follow their paths in the given schedule.

    - algorithm_test: simulates paths and schedules robots, generates coordination graphs.

    - turtle_teleporter_publisher:  generates turtles from turtlesim library, generates paths for the turtles, and calculates schedules for the paths.

    - turtle_teleporter_subscriber: makes the turtles follow their paths in the given schedule, does this by teleporting the turtles using turtlesim teleport service.

- Steps to run the turtle simulation:
    - If you want to execute turtle scheduling with velocities, in a new terminal run: roslaunch path_scheduling_turtle_sim_tests path_planning_turtle_sim.launch
    - If you want to execute turtle scheduling by teleporting, in a new terminal run: roslaunch path_scheduling_turtle_sim_tests path_planning_turtle_teleporter_sim.launch
      
- Alternatively:
    - In a new terminal run: roscore
    - In a new terminal run: rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node 
    - In a new terminal (source your workspace if not sourced) run: rosrun path_scheduling_turtle_sim_tests turtle_publisher 
    - In a new terminal (source your workspace if not sourced) run: rosrun path_scheduling_turtle_sim_tests turtle_subscriber
    - Note: If you wish to run turtle teleporter use turtle_teleporter_publisher and turtle_teleporter_subscriber instead
- If you wish to only run the RRT, RRT* and see the outputs:

    - In a new terminal (source your workspace if not sourced) run: rosrun multi_robot_path_scheduling algorithm_test

## Methodology

### Definitions

A set of robots that are instructed to move along specified paths. The paths of the robots are subject to change in the event of an interruption during their movement. A robot *N* is defined in the 2-D configuration space C such that:

- Every robot follows a path _π_<sub>_n_</sub>. 

- A path is a sequence of adjacent segments and each segment s<sub>i</sub> ∈ [0, _l_(π<sub>i</sub> )], where _l_(π<sub>i</sub> ) is the total length of the path.

- Finally, the space occupied by a robot in configuration x<sub>i</sub> is represented as _A_(x<sub>i</sub> ).

## Coordination Diagram

Coordination diagrams represent all possible configurations and collusion regions along a robots path. Finding an obstacle free map from (0,0) to (1,1) in a coordination diagram provides a solution to the coordination problem, therefore they are commonly used in path coordination tasks. They were first introduced in [1].

<img src="https://github.com/yagizalkilic/multi_robot_path_planning/assets/43394146/1ef02f71-8533-4ce4-937c-32d34ef7d100" alt="1ef02f71-8533-4ce4-937c-32d34ef7d100" style="zoom:80%;" />

### Constructing the Diagram: Collusion Zones

In order to construct the diagram, collusion zones can be defined as in [2]:

```math
X_{ij}^{coll} \ =\ \{\ ( s_{1} \ ,...,\ s_{N}\} \ \in \ S\ |\ A( \pi _{i}( s_{i})) \ \cap \ A( \pi _{j}( s_{j})) \ \neq \ \emptyset \ \}
```

#### A Simpler Approach

If the robots assumed to be circular in shape and equal in size, the formulation above can be simplified to as in [3]:

```math
X_{ij}^{coll} \ =\ \{\ ( s_{1} \ ,...,\ s_{N}\} \ \in \ S\ |\ ||\ \pi _{i}( s_{i}) \ -\ \pi _{j}( s_{j}) \ ||\ \geq \ 2r\ \}
```

Where r is the radius of a robot.

#### Traces

In order to get a more accurate representation of the collusion space, the traces that robots create during their path can be examined as was done in [4].

<img src="https://github.com/yagizalkilic/multi_robot_path_planning/assets/43394146/e57342dc-c05e-4b91-bb86-4be2dc9d06e9" alt="image-e57342dc-c05e-4b91-bb86-4be2dc9d06e9" style="zoom:80%;" />

##### Approach 1: Spatial Discretization

[4] mentions that the robots in question are considered to be convex polygonal robots that move along paths that are either straight line segments or arcs of a circle. Utilizing this property, it is possible to decompose the path into elementary collusion subpaths and compute separate coordination diagrams for decomposed path segments and combine them later.

Complexity of the collusion zone finding algorithm in [4]: *O*( *n* + *k* log( *k* ) ) where *n* represents amount of curves and *k* represents amount of parts which is half of the intersection amount *2k*.

##### Approach 2: Temporal Discretization

[9] suggests a method that is more precise than the method mentioned above. 

### Constructing the Diagram: Bounded Box Representation

With the bounding box approach an exact computation of the obstacles is not needed. 

<img src="https://github.com/yagizalkilic/multi_robot_path_planning/assets/43394146/a41935d8-b1cb-496f-b658-ff9dccd43c1f" alt="a41935d8-b1cb-496f-b658-ff9dccd43c1f" style="zoom:80%;" />

However, this method has its setbacks as an existing solution can be lost if there exist one vertical and one horizontal line intersecting two obstacles as seen below.

![image-20230714104300910](https://github.com/yagizalkilic/multi_robot_path_planning/assets/43394146/da17203d-a6d8-4268-a289-1c87cdd7169f)

### Constructing the Diagram: The n-Dimension Problem

When n robot paths are considered, the coordination diagram that would represent the collusion set becomes an n-dimensional cube.  Therefore, an obstacle would be represented as a collection of points(s~1~, s~2~ , ... , s~n~) where at least two robots collide. Computation of multi-dimensional obstacles is costly and hard to implement. 

The n-dimensional space can instead be represented as a 2-D space by computing 2-D diagrams of each pair of robots. For *n* robots *n (n - 1) / 2* diagrams will be produced as shown in [4]. One such representation can be seen below where 5 robots occupy a coordination space.

## Coordination Planner

After the coordination diagram is drawn, the optimal coordination path needs to be determined. The problem becomes that of finding a path in a directed graph. Algorithms can be selected to minimize, or fix the arrival time as in [8]. 

![image-20230714123136606](https://github.com/yagizalkilic/multi_robot_path_planning/assets/43394146/cf200883-1940-4418-83c0-e07d3e0cdd7f)


[5] separates the regions on a coordination diagram to put a constraint on the possible paths so that inefficient and blocking actions are filtered out. 

- Light region: All actions are possible.
- Antumbra region: Close to collusion, all actions are permitted as long as there is no change in region.
- Penumbra region: One robot has entered the path of another robot.
- Umbra region: Robots have reached a common portion of the map.
- Obstacle border: Forbidden.

Note that in a bounding box representation Umbra region would be discarded.

## Supplementary Findings

### Unexpected Events

In the context of a warehouse, calculating the coordination path again at every change in the overall navigation would be inefficient as there can be constant changes in path-finding due to interruptions. In such a case, an incremental algorithm that makes changes "on the fly" can be more desirable. The algorithm in [5] aims to create such a system that can predict and avoid such interruptions.

### Addition of Roadmaps 

Introduction of predetermined roadmaps to the system can increase the computation efficiency. This is done by computing sub-coordination diagrams offline and creating the coordination diagram online by combining the necessary sub-coordination diagrams. Depending on the given configuration of robots and paths a new coordination diagram can be produced much faster this way.

### Undirected Graph Approach

Many methods such as [6] utilize an undirected graph structure that symbolizes the coordination field. While this approach is not applicable to the problem statement, it can be utilized in certain scenarios where robots would be constrained to use paths that are suitable only for a single robot to pass at a time such as tight corridors. 

## Kinematics

To be considered later. [7] could provide insight.
